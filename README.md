Robot-Demo-With-Selenium
========================
Robot Framework is a generic test automation framework for acceptance testing and acceptance test-driven development (ATDD). It has easy-to-use tabular test data syntax and it utilizes the keyword-driven testing approach. Its testing capabilities can be extended by test libraries implemented either with Python or Java, and users can create new higher-level keywords from existing ones using the same syntax that is used for creating test cases.

This is a very simplistic approach to demonstrate a typical robot framework that uses Selenium2Library. It serves to show how it is relatively simple to get started up with testing using the framework. We will also be triggering this test through Jenkins as well.
